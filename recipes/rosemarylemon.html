            Ingredients
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup butter</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
            <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>6 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>       
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a food processor, blend butter, rosemary, garlic, lemon zest,<br> and lemon juice together. Pour 1/3 of the blended mixture into a small bowl for marinade. Cover remaining mixture, and set aside.            </li>
            <li>Lightly season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Rub chicken breasts<br> with marinade. Place chicken breasts on a platter, cover, and refrigerate for 3 hours.            </li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.<br> Transfer half of the reserved rosemary and lemon mixture into a bowl for basting. Cover <br>remaining mixture, and set aside for topping cooked chicken.            </li>
            <li>Cook chicken breasts on hot grill, basting with rosemary and lemon basting <br>mixture, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the <br>center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken breasts from the grill,<br> and top with remaining rosemary and lemon mixture. </li>
